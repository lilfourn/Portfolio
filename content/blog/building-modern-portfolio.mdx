# Building a Modern Web Portfolio with Next.js

Creating a modern web portfolio is essential for showcasing your work and skills in today's digital landscape. In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through building a portfolio website using Next.js, React, and TypeScript.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js has become the go-to framework for React applications, offering:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** for better performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for blazing-fast page loads
- **API Routes** for backend functionality
- **File-system Based Routing** for intuitive navigation

## Getting Started

First, let's create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest portfolio --typescript --tailwind
cd portfolio
```

## Project Structure

Here's how we'll organize our project:

```
portfolio/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â””â”€â”€ content/
```

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Routing

Next.js makes routing simple with its file-system based approach:

```typescript
// app/[slug]/page.tsx
export default function ProjectPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Project: {params.slug}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Responsive Design

Using Tailwind CSS for responsive layouts:

```typescript
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
  {projects.map((project) => (
    <ProjectCard key={project.id} {...project} />
  ))}
</div>
```

### 3. Animations

Adding smooth animations with Framer Motion:

```typescript
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
>
  <h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
</motion.div>
```

## Performance Optimization

### Image Optimization

Next.js provides built-in image optimization:

```typescript
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/project-thumbnail.jpg"
  alt="Project Thumbnail"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  priority
/>
```

### Font Optimization

Using Next.js 13's built-in font optimization:

```typescript
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })
```

## Deployment

Deploy your portfolio using Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Configure your deployment settings
4. Deploy!

## Conclusion

Building a modern portfolio with Next.js gives you a fast, SEO-friendly, and maintainable website. The combination of Next.js, React, and TypeScript provides a robust foundation for showcasing your work professionally.

Remember to:
- Keep your code clean and maintainable
- Optimize images and assets
- Test across different devices
- Regularly update your content

Happy coding! ðŸš€
